 StereoReconstruction Project File
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This library uses C++0x functionality that exists in GCC 4.5 and Visual
 Studio 2010 (or later versions). The following dependencies are required
 when building StereoRecontruction:

   - Qt 4.7.3 SDK
   - OpenCV 2.2
   - gsl 1.14
   - Boost 1.46
   - Eigen 2.x
   - GLEW 1.5.8

 Additionally, some options (see "Tunable Options" below) will require
 additional libraries:

   - OpenEXR 1.6.1 (when hdr option enabled)
   - Intel TBB 3.0 (when tbb option enabled)
   - Point Grey Research FlyCap 2.x SDK (when pgr option enabled)
   - Point Grey Research Digiclops SDK (when pgr option enabled)
   - Point Grey Research Triclops SDK (when pgr option enabled)
   - Middlebury MRF library (when mrf option enabled)

 The recommended environment for building StereoReconstruction is
 Qt Creator 2.x.

 Tunable Options
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 User-specific configuration options should be placed in a file named
 `UserConfig.pri` in the same directory as the project file. Various
 options that can be added to the CONFIG variable:

   - hdr: Enables HDR imaging options

   - tbb: Use Intel Thread Building Blocks library for parallel
       computation whenever possible.

   - openmp: Use OpenMP for parallel computation whenever possible.
       If tbb is specified then OpenMP is ignored.

   - mrf: Use MRF optimization for stereo, with the TRW-S method. If
       not enabled, winner-take-all is used.

   - splats: Use splats when rendering point clouds. If not enabled,
       basic point rendering is used.

   - pgr: Link against and use the PointGrey FlyCap SDK for image
       capturing functionality.

 Also, be sure to specify any non-standard library/include paths in
 your user config file. To see which libraries are included for each
 of the above options, browse down through this file.
